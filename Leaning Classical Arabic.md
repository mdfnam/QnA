# Learning Classical Arabic

## Approach for Learning
There are two different approaches that people typically take when learning any language. They are:
- **Approach 1:** Starting with speaking skills.
- **Aprroach 2:** Starting with reading skills and then comprehending the written text.

### Our Approach
Based on the goals of individuals, whether they aim for fluency in speaking Arabic or wish to read and understand books, they can choose an approach aligned with their specific objectives. Given that our primary focus is to comprehend the Quranic text, we will be adopting the second approach.
- **Problem with Apporach 1:** A common issue arises when we prioritize speaking skills at the expense of understanding written text is that we are only taught how to construct sentences from our thoughts, with insufficient emphasis on the ability to comprehend the written text. Consequently, even after years of study, when we read the Quran, we might not feel a strong connection. This happens because the emphasis was on output (speaking) rather than input (understanding what you read).
- **Why to choose Approach 2:** When studying Arabic as a Muslim, a primary motivation often lies in the desire to connect with the Quran while reading. Therefore, top priority is given to developing skills in reading Classical Arabic with comprehension. Proficiency in these skills will lead to a deep moral connection with the Quran. Thus, it is crucial to start by mastering the art of reading with comprehension.

### Prerequisite: Reading Arabic
- A fundamental prerequisite for undertaking this course is having the ability to read Arabic, particularly Quranic Script (having tashkeel). Without this foundational skill, you cannot pursue this particular course.
- If you already possess the capability to read Arabic, even if you encounter difficulties with certain words or are not proficient in tajweed (it is the set of rules and guidelines for the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Qur’an), you are still eligible to enroll in the course.
- However, I want to emphasize that if you do not have a basic understanding of how to read Quranic Arabic, you must learn it before taking this course.
- **Advise:** You can read the Quran for 10 minutes daily online, practice it on `quran.com`, select a reciter there, and try to synchronize your voice along with the reciter. This practice will enhance your pronunciation and reading of Quranic Arabic.

## Branches of Arabic
There are three fundamental sciences in the study of the Arabic language, particularly within the context of classical Arabic studies. These sciences focus on different aspects of the language:
- Nahw (or, nahu)
- Sarf
- Balagha

### Nahw
Nahw `نَحْوُ`, also known as Arabic grammar, is the study of the structure and syntax of sentences. It focuses on the rules and principles governing how words are arranged to form meaningful sentences.

**Note:** We will commence our journey by exploring grammar, and as the need arises, we will gradually incorporate vocabulary into our learning process.
<!-- we are taking an english example to uderstand what nahw is : I am a teacher. MY name is furquan. They loved me. Here in this 3 sentence all the words I, my and me are referring to myself even though i can't use them interchangibly. 
- It is a system by which we will be able to know to use what word where. When we use a wrong word in a sentence then it is a wrong nahw.-->

### Sarf  
Sarf `صَرْفُ`, also known as Arabic morphology, is the study of the internal structure of words and how they change to convey different meanings. It focuses on the pattern of how root letters are manipulated to create nouns, verbs and other word forms, while also indicating changes in factors such as tense, number, gender, and other grammatical aspects.
<!-- To form the doer of the verb 'teach,' add 'er' to create 'teacher.' To express the ongoing action of this verb in the present, append 'ing,' resulting in 'teaching'. This can be an example to understand the sarf better 
- It is a system by which we will be able to generate words. -->

### Balagha  
Balagha `بَلاغَةُ`, also known as Arabic rhetoric or eloquence, is the study of how language can be used effectively to convey meaning and create beauty in speech. It explores various figures of speech and techniques, such as repetition, parallelism, and metaphor (comparison between two unrelated things), to enhance the impact of communication.

### Order of learning 
- In the traditional way of studying Arabic, the typical order is to start with Nahw and then progress to Sarf before delving into Balagha.
- This sequence is often recommended because a solid understanding of Nahw provides a foundation for comprehending the structure and function of words in a sentence, which is beneficial when studying Sarf.
- Balagha builds on the foundation of Nahw and Sarf. Therefore, studying Balagha is typically recommended after acquiring a solid understanding of Nahw and Sarf, as it involves more advanced linguistic and rhetorical concepts. Ultimately, this advanced study enhances one's ability to express ideas in a more sophisticated and eloquent manner.

**Next:** Now, we will study the most fundamental component of any language: the word. It is the basic building block that forms the foundation of any language. Subsequently, we will explore different kinds of words in Arabic.
