# Before The Course

## Prerequisite For This Course
- A fundamental prerequisite for undertaking this course is having the ability to read Arabic, particularly Quranic Script. Without this foundational skill, you cannot pursue this particular course.
- If you already possess the capability to read Arabic, even if you encounter difficulties with certain words or are not proficient in tajweed (it is the set of rules and guidelines for the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Qur’an), you are still eligible to enroll in the course.
- However, I want to emphasize that if you do not have a basic understanding of how to read Quranic Arabic, you must learn it before taking this course.
- **Advise:** You can read the Quran for 10 minutes daily online, practice it on `quran.com`, select a reciter there, and try to synchronize your voice along with the reciter. This practice will enhance your pronunciation and reading of Quranic Arabic.

## Four Skills
We are required to possess these four skills in order to learn any language:
1. Reading with comprehension
2. Listening with comprehension
3. Speaking properly
4. Writing properly

**Problem:**
- A common issue arises when various language programs prioritize speaking skills at the expense of understanding written text. These programs focus on teaching you how to construct sentences from your thoughts, but they may not place sufficient emphasis on the crucial aspect of understanding written text. Consequently, even after years of study, when you read the Quran, you might not feel a strong connection. This happens because the emphasis was on output (speaking) rather than input (understanding what you read).

**Solution:**
- When studying Arabic as a Muslim, a primary motivation is often the desire to connect with the Quran when we hear it being recited or while we are reading it. Therefore, the top priority is given to the skills of listening and reading Arabic with comprehension. Developing proficiency in these skills will lead to a deep moral connection with the Quran.
- At the beginner level, comprehension through listening is more challenging than comprehension through reading, primarily due to the difference in pace, making it difficult for learners to keep up while simultaneously processing the information. Reading, on the other hand, allows learners to control the pace, enabling them to comprehend each word more effectively.
- Once our reading and comprehension skills improve and become second nature, listening skills also progress. With practice, we will begin forming small sentences and gradually advance to more complex sentences, ultimately enhancing our speaking skills. Subsequently, efforts can be directed towards improving writing skills. To achieve all this, we should start by mastering reading with comprehension. Since we are already familiar with reading, our primary focus will be on understanding the Arabic language.

## Branches of Arabic
There are three fundamental sciences in the study of the Arabic language, particularly within the context of classical Arabic studies. These sciences focus on different aspects of the language:
- Nahw (or, nahu)
- Sarf
- Balagha

### Nahw نَحْوُ
Nahw, also known as Arabic grammar, is the study of the structure and syntax of sentences. It focuses on the rules and principles governing how words are arranged to form meaningful sentences.

### Sarf صَرْفُ 
Sarf, also known as Arabic morphology, is the study of the internal structure of words and how they change to convey different meanings. It focuses on the pattern of how root letters are manipulated to create nouns, verbs and other word forms, while also indicating changes in factors such as tense, number, gender, and other grammatical aspects.

### Balagha بَلاغَةُ 
Balagha, also known as Arabic rhetoric or eloquence, is the study of how language can be used effectively to convey meaning and create beauty in speech. It explores various figures of speech and techniques, such as repetition, parallelism, and metaphor, to enhance the impact of communication.

**Note:** We will start our study with Nahu - Arabic Grammar and with time, as the need arises, we will learn vocabulary.

## Importance of Arabic Grammar
Grammar teaches us the way to put vocabulary in a proper and organized way so that it make sense. After learning it, we will not only be able to translate a sentence correctly but also understand:
- How Allah (SWT) put these words together?
- Why did Allah (SWT) put these words together in such an order?
- What if we rearranged them?
