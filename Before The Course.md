# Before The Course

## Prerequisite For This Course
- A fundamental prerequisite for undertaking this course is having the ability to read Arabic, particularly Quranic Script. Without this foundational skill, you cannot pursue this particular course.
- If you already possess the capability to read Arabic, even if you encounter difficulties with certain words or are not proficient in tajweed (it is the set of rules and guidelines for the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Qurâ€™an), you are still eligible to enroll in the course.
- However, I want to emphasize that if you do not have a basic understanding of how to read Quranic Arabic, you must learn it before taking this course.
- **Advise:** You can read the Quran for 10 minutes daily online, practice it on `quran.com`, select a reciter there, and try to synchronize your voice along with the reciter. This practice will enhance your pronunciation and reading of Quranic Arabic.

## topic name
We required to know these four skills in order to learn any language: 
1. Reading with comprehension
2. Listening with comprehension
3. Speaking properly
4. Writing properly
Among these two are data inputs and two are data outputs. The data input going inside of you and you are processing it and among these two data inputs are 1 and 2. The data output is that you have to come up with something by yourself so among these last two 3 and 4 are data outputs. If we are studying arabic as muslim then the number one motivation for us is that we want to feel something when we hear the quran being recited or while we are reading the quran , we wanna to connect with the text either by listening or reading, so when we want to work with arabic as muslim the top two skill among these are 1 and 2 which become our priority. Listening and reading become a bigger priority and the more those skills develop we start feeling like a moral connection with the Quran. Now the problem with starting with 3 i.e. speaking skills which a lot of language programs do in which you will be learning skill of making sentences from your thoughts but is not working on how to understand text, as a result after years of stdying that when we open up the quran you still don't feel yourself connected because your focus was not input your focus was on output (and those kinds of programs are always teaching standard arabic first because it is what we use it today to communicate with each other). So speaking and writing is a later goal, purpose of this course is to directly connect you with the Quran, when the quran is being recited or you reading it by yourself. So our focus is going to be on listening and reading. Now between these two 1 and 2 listening and understanding is harder becuase of the speed because when one is reciting he is moving in his speed and we can not keep up because we are still taking the time to process what he said which is a slow process but when we are reading it is us who decides the speed and do comprehension at each word which is not possible when we are listening somebody. Once our reading gets really good naturally our listening is start to get good, start to getting better and better. And we its become second nature we will automatically be making small sentences and then later on big sentences which will eventually enhance our speaking skill and then later on working on writing skills we can also make it better but for all this we should need to start with 1 that is Reading with comprehension. And in this even we know the reading so the only task on which we will be focusing is on comprehension (understanding) the arabic language.
