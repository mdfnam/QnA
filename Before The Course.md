# Before The Course

## Prerequisite For This Course
- A fundamental prerequisite for undertaking this course is having the ability to read Arabic, particularly Quranic Script. Without this foundational skill, you cannot pursue this particular course.
- If you already possess the capability to read Arabic, even if you encounter difficulties with certain words or are not proficient in tajweed (it is the set of rules and guidelines for the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Qurâ€™an), you are still eligible to enroll in the course.
- However, I want to emphasize that if you do not have a basic understanding of how to read Quranic Arabic, you must learn it before taking this course.
- **Advise:** You can read the Quran for 10 minutes daily online, practice it on `quran.com`, select a reciter there, and try to synchronize your voice along with the reciter. This practice will enhance your pronunciation and reading of Quranic Arabic.
