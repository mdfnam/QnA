# Branches of Arabic

## Three Branches 
There are three fundamental sciences in the study of the Arabic language, particularly within the context of classical Arabic studies. These sciences focus on different aspects of the language:
- Nahw (or, nahu)
- Sarf
- Balagha

### Nahw نَحْوُ
Nahw, also known as Arabic grammar, is the study of the structure and syntax of sentences. It focuses on the rules and principles governing how words are arranged to form meaningful sentences.

### Sarf صَرْفُ 
Sarf, also known as Arabic morphology, is the study of the internal structure of words and how they change to convey different meanings. It focuses on the pattern of how root letters are manipulated to create nouns, verbs and other word forms, while also indicating changes in factors such as tense, number, gender, and other grammatical aspects.

### Balagha بَلاغَةُ 
Balagha, also known as Arabic rhetoric or eloquence, is the study of how language can be used effectively to convey meaning and create beauty in speech. It explores various figures of speech and techniques, such as repetition, parallelism, and metaphor, to enhance the impact of communication.

We will start our study with Nahu - Arabic Grammar.
