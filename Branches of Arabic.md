# Branches of Arabic

## Three Branches 
There are three fundamental sciences in the study of the Arabic language, particularly within the context of classical Arabic studies. These sciences focus on different aspects of the language:
- Nahw (or, nahu)
- Sarf
- Balagha

### Nahw
Nahw `نَحْوُ`, also known as Arabic grammar, is the study of the structure and syntax of sentences. It focuses on the rules and principles governing how words are arranged to form meaningful sentences.

### Sarf  
Sarf `صَرْفُ`, also known as Arabic morphology, is the study of the internal structure of words and how they change to convey different meanings. It focuses on the pattern of how root letters are manipulated to create nouns, verbs and other word forms, while also indicating changes in factors such as tense, number, gender, and other grammatical aspects.
<!-- To form the doer of the verb 'teach,' add 'er' to create 'teacher.' To express the ongoing action of this verb in the present, append 'ing,' resulting in 'teaching'. This can be an example to understand the sarf better -->

### Balagha  
Balagha `بَلاغَةُ`, also known as Arabic rhetoric or eloquence, is the study of how language can be used effectively to convey meaning and create beauty in speech. It explores various figures of speech and techniques, such as repetition, parallelism, and metaphor (comparison between two unrelated things), to enhance the impact of communication.

### Order of learning 
- In the traditional way of studying Arabic, the typical order is to start with Nahw (Arabic grammar) and then progress to Sarf (Structure of words) before delving into Balagha (Rhetoric).
- This sequence is often recommended because a solid understanding of Nahw provides a foundation for comprehending the structure and function of words in a sentence, which is beneficial when studying Sarf.
- Balagha builds on the foundation of Nahw and Sarf. Therefore, studying Balagha is typically recommended after acquiring a solid understanding of Nahw and Sarf, as it involves more advanced linguistic and rhetorical concepts. Ultimately, this advanced study enhances one's ability to express ideas in a more sophisticated and eloquent manner.
