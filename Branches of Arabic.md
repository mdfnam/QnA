# Branches of Arabic

## Three Branches 
There are three fundamental sciences in the study of the Arabic language, particularly within the context of classical Arabic studies. These sciences focus on different aspects of the language:
- Nahw (or, nahu)
- Sarf
- Balagha

### Nahw
Nahw `نَحْوُ`, also known as Arabic grammar, is the study of the structure and syntax of sentences. It focuses on the rules and principles governing how words are arranged to form meaningful sentences.

### Sarf  
Sarf `صَرْفُ`, also known as Arabic morphology, is the study of the internal structure of words and how they change to convey different meanings. It focuses on the pattern of how root letters are manipulated to create nouns, verbs and other word forms, while also indicating changes in factors such as tense, number, gender, and other grammatical aspects.

### Balagha  
Balagha `بَلاغَةُ`, also known as Arabic rhetoric or eloquence, is the study of how language can be used effectively to convey meaning and create beauty in speech. It explores various figures of speech and techniques, such as repetition, parallelism, and metaphor, to enhance the impact of communication.

**Note:** We will start our study with Nahu - Arabic Grammar and with time, as the need arises, we will learn vocabulary.

## Importance of Arabic Grammar
Grammar teaches us the way to put vocabulary in a proper and organized way so that it make sense. After learning it, we will not only be able to translate a sentence correctly but also understand:
- How Allah (SWT) put these words together?
- Why did Allah (SWT) put these words together in such an order?
- What if we rearranged them?
