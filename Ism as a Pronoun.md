# Ism as a Pronoun

## Defining Pronouns

There are several kinds of pronouns, each serving a different purpose. Here are some common types of pronouns:
- Personal Pronouns
- Demostrative Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns
- Personal Pronouns are simple pronouns that are used to substitute proper names. They change form based on person, number, gender and case.

### Person
Person indicates the perspective of the speaker in relation to the noun being referred to.
- First-person pronouns are used to refer to the person speaking (speaker).
- Second-person pronouns is used to refer to the person being directly addressed or spoken to (listener).
- Third-person pronouns are used to refer to anyone or anything else that is being talked about, apart from the speaker or the listener.

### Number
Number indicates whether the pronoun refers to an individual noun or to a group of two or more.
- Singular pronouns are used to refer to an individual noun.
- Plural pronouns are used to refer to two or more individual nouns.

### Gender
Gender indicates the gender of the specific individual being referred to.
- Masculine pronouns are used to refer to males (men and boys).
- Feminine pronouns are used to refer to females (women and girls).
- Genderless pronouns are used to refer non human objects that donâ€™t have a specific gender (neither masculine nor feminine).
- Gender-Neutral pronouns are used to refer to groups of two or more people (same or different gender) or things (genderless).

**Note:** First Person Pronouns like I, me and you are used to refer to individuals, regardless of gender.

### Case
Case indicates the grammatical role that the pronoun plays in a sentence.
- Subject pronouns are used to refer to the nouns that serve as the subject of a sentence.
