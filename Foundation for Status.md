## Defining Noun
A noun is a word that represents a beings, place, thing or concept (idea).
- beings : It refers to the creator and all of his living creations : people, animal, angel, jinn & devil.
- place : It refers to a location or an area.
- thing : It refers to non living object which you can see and touch.
- concept : It refers to an abstract notion or an idea that have not any physical presence.

**Note:** In the context of our discussion, we have included the term 'creator' within the section labeled 'beings' for linguistic or grammatical purposes only, while acknowledging that Almighty is beyond all categories and limitations.

### Classification of Noun
Nouns can be classified into two main categories: Proper nouns and Common nouns.
- Proper nouns are specific name of any particular beings, place, thing or concept. They are always capitalized.
- Common nouns are more generic (nonspecific) as they represent general names for any beings, places, things, or concepts. They are only capitalized when they start a sentence.

**Note:** Using ‘the’ before a common noun does not make it proper but rather definite or specific.

### Examples of Nouns

**Note:** When referencing the word 'Allah’, it is important to use 'The Word Allah' for being respectful as we are discussing the word 'Allah’, not addressing Allah (SWT) Himself.

### Idea-Adjective-Adverb
- Islam-Islamic-Islamically
- Example: He embraced Islam and became a Muslim. To gain knowledge about the religion, he enrolled himself in an Islamic institute. Now, he dresses Islamically and goes there every day after Fajr.

## Defining Articles
Articles precede nouns, serving the purpose of indicating whether the noun refers to something specific & identifiable or something nonspecific & general. In English, we have three articles, they are ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

### Classification of Articles 
Articles can be classified into two categories: Definite Article and Indefinite Article.

### Definite Article
- Definite Article (the): It is used before a noun that both the speaker and the listener know about or have previously discussed. It is applicable to both proper and common nouns.
- Example: “The Quran” (use before proper noun), "The book" (use before common noun)
**Note:** 
- In Arabic, we use ‘ال’  (pronounced as ‘al’) as the definite article, which is attached to the beginning of a word.
- In English, word ‘the’ appears separate from the actual word, whereas in Arabic, the word itself contains the meaning of ‘the’, so we often need two English words to express what a single Arabic word conveys.

### Indefinite Article
- Indefinite Articles (a & an): These are used before general or nonspecific nouns, primarly with singular common nouns.
- Example: “A book” or “An elephant” (use before common noun)
**Note:**
- In Arabic, all ism are generally considered indefinite unless specified otherwise. Unlike English, Arabic doesn't have a distinct word equivalent to the English indefinite articles 'a' or 'an.' Instead, the sense of indefiniteness is often conveyed through the absence of the definite article ‘ال’.
- When translating "كِتَابٌ" independently, it is often rendered as 'book.' In English, it's typicall to use an indefinite article when referring to a singular, unspecified common noun within a sentence. Consequently, when "كِتَابٌ" is integrated into a sentence, it is translated as 'a book.'

## Defining Pronouns
A pronoun is a word that represents a noun which is used to replace nouns to prevent repetition and provide clarity in a sentence.

### Personal Pronouns
- Personal Pronouns are simple pronouns that are used to substitute proper names. They change form based on person, number, gender and case.

#### Person
Person indicates the perspective of the speaker in relation to the noun being referred to.
- First-person pronouns: [ I, We, Me, Us ] are used to refer to the person speaking (speaker)
