## Defining Noun
A noun is a word that represents a beings, place, thing or concept (idea).
- beings : It refers to the creator and all of his living creations : people, animal, angel, jinn & devil.
- place : It refers to a location or an area.
- thing : It refers to non living object which you can see and touch.
- concept : It refers to an abstract notion or an idea that have not any physical presence.

**Note:** In the context of our discussion, we have included the term 'creator' within the section labeled 'beings' for linguistic or grammatical purposes only, while acknowledging that Almighty is beyond all categories and limitations.

### Classification of Noun
Nouns can be classified into two main categories: Proper nouns and Common nouns.
- Proper nouns are specific name of any particular beings, place, thing or concept. They are always capitalized.
- Common nouns are more generic (nonspecific) as they represent general names for any beings, places, things, or concepts. They are only capitalized when they start a sentence.

**Note:** Using ‘the’ before a common noun does not make it proper but rather definite or specific.

**Note:** When referencing the word 'Allah’, it is important to use 'The Word Allah' for being respectful as we are discussing the word 'Allah’, not addressing Allah (SWT) Himself.

- Example: He embraced Islam and became a Muslim. To gain knowledge about the religion, he enrolled himself in an Islamic institute. Now, he dresses Islamically and goes there every day after Fajr.

## Defining Articles
Articles precede nouns, serving the purpose of indicating whether the noun refers to something specific & identifiable or something nonspecific & general. In English, we have three articles, they are ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

Articles can be classified into two categories: Definite Article and Indefinite Article.
