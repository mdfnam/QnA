## Defining Noun
A noun is a word that represents a beings, place, thing or concept (idea).
- beings : It refers to the creator and all of his living creations : people, animal, angel, jinn & devil.
- place : It refers to a location or an area.
- thing : It refers to non living object which you can see and touch.
- concept : It refers to an abstract notion or an idea that have not any physical presence.

**Note:** In the context of our discussion, we have included the term 'creator' within the section labeled 'beings' for linguistic or grammatical purposes only, while acknowledging that Almighty is beyond all categories and limitations.

### Classification of Noun
Nouns can be classified into two main categories: Proper nouns and Common nouns.
- Proper nouns are specific name of any particular being, place, thing or concept. They are always capitalized.
- Common nouns are more generic (nonspecific) as they represent general name for any being, place, thing, or concept. They are only capitalized when they start a sentence.

**Note:** Using ‘the’ before a common noun does not make it proper but rather definite.

### Examples of Nouns

</p>

**Note:** When discussing the word 'Allah’, it is important to use 'The Word Allah' for being respectful as we are discussing the word 'Allah’, not addressing Allah (SWT) Himself.

### Idea-Adjective-Adverb
- Islam-Islamic-Islamically
- Example: He embraced Islam and became a Muslim. To gain knowledge about the religion, he enrolled himself in an Islamic institute. Now, he dresses Islamically and goes there every day after Fajr.

## Defining Articles
Articles precede nouns, serving the purpose of indicating whether the noun refers to something specific & identifiable or something nonspecific & general. In English, we have three articles, they are ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

### Classification of Articles 
Articles can be classified into two categories: Definite Article and Indefinite Article.

### Definite Article
- Definite Article (the): It is used before a noun that both the speaker and the listener know about or have previously discussed. It can be used before both proper and common nouns.
- Example: “The Quran” (used before proper noun), "The book" (used before common noun)

</p>

**Note:** 
- In Arabic, we use ‘ال’  (pronounced as ‘al’) as the definite article, which is attached to the beginning of a word.
- In English, word ‘the’ appears separate from the actual word, whereas in Arabic, the word itself contains the meaning of ‘the’, so we often need two English words to express what a single Arabic word conveys.

### Indefinite Article
- Indefinite Articles (a & an): These are used before general or nonspecific nouns, primarly with singular common nouns.
- Example: “A book” or “An elephant” (used before common noun)

</p>

**Note:**
- Unlike English, Arabic lacks a distinct word equivalent to the English indefinite articles 'a' or 'an.' Instead, the sense of indefiniteness is often conveyed through the absence of the definite article 'ال'.
- When translating "كِتَابٌ" independently, it is often rendered as 'book'. When we use a singular, unspecified common noun within a sentence, it's common to use an indefinite article before it. Consequently, when "كِتَابٌ" is integrated into a sentence, it is translated as 'a book.'

## Defining Pronouns
A pronoun is a word that represents a noun which is used to replace nouns to prevent repetition and provide clarity in a sentence.

### Personal Pronouns
- Personal Pronouns are simple pronouns that are used to substitute proper names. They change form based on person, number, gender and case.

#### Person
Person indicates the perspective of the speaker in relation to the noun being referred to.
- First-person pronouns are used to refer to the person speaking (speaker).
- Second-person pronouns is used to refer to the person being directly addressed or spoken to (listener).
- Third-person pronouns are used to refer to anyone or anything else that is being talked about, apart from the speaker or the listener.

#### Number
Number indicates whether the pronoun refers to an individual noun or to a group of two or more.
- Singular pronouns are used to refer to an individual noun.
- Plural pronouns are used to refer to two or more individual nouns.

#### Gender
Gender indicates the gender of the specific individual being referred to.
- Masculine pronouns are used to refer to males (men and boys).
- Feminine pronouns are used to refer to females (women and girls).
- Genderless pronouns are used to refer non human objects that don’t have a specific gender (neither masculine nor feminine).
- Gender-Neutral pronouns are used to refer to groups of two or more people (same or different gender) or things (genderless).

**Note:** First Person Pronouns like I, me and you are used to refer to individuals, regardless of gender.

#### Case
Case indicates the grammatical role that the pronoun plays in a sentence.
- Subject pronouns are used to refer to the nouns that serve as the subject of a sentence.
- Object pronouns are used to refer to the nouns that serve as the object of a sentence.

## Defining Adjective 
An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun.

### Possessive Adjective
Possessive adjective are used to show ownership or possession of a noun, typically come before the noun and indicate to whom or to what something belongs.

### Nominative Case
- **Definition:** The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, which is typically a noun or a pronoun that performs the action of the verb or is the "doer" of the action in a sentence.
- **Identification:** To identify a noun in the nominative case, form a question using 'What?' or 'Who?' before the verb. Use 'What?' when the noun represents a thing and 'Who?' when it represents a person.

### Genitive Case

#### Understanding Terms
- Possession: refers to the state of owning, having a relationship with, or belonging to something.
- Possessor: refers to the individual who owns or possesses something (owner).
- Possessed object: refers to the item being possessed (the thing that is owned).

#### Expressing possession
In English, possession can be expressed through:
- **Apostrophe possession:** This possession is expressed by the apostrophe followed by an “s” on possessor & then the possessed object. This form is used when we want to emphasize the possessor.
- **"of " possession:** This possession is expressed by the possessed object followed by "of " and then the possessor. This form is used when we want to emphasize the possessed thing.
- **Possessive adjective possession:** This possession is expressed by the possessive adjective (which is possessor) followed by the possessed object. These adjectives directly modify the noun to show possession.
