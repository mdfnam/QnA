# Parts of Speech

## Components of the Arabic Language
- **Lafz `لَفْظ`:** It specifically refers to a single word or a single utterance (it denotes every sound produced by the tongue). These utterances can be further divided into two categories based on whether they convey meaning or not: Muhmal and Mawdu.
- **Muhmal `مُهْمَل`:** Refers to meaningless words that do not carry any meaning. Since we are studying the Quran, in which no meaningless words are present, we have nothing to worry about in this regard.
- **Mawdu `مَوْضُوع`:** Refers to meaningful words that carries meaning. This will be our main emphasis during our studies.

- **Kalimah `كَلِمَة`:** A single meaningful word is referred to as ‘kalimah’, which is the most fundamental component of Arabic language. It serves as the basic building block that forms the foundation of the language. Kalimah can be further divided into three types, also known as ‘parts of speech’.

## Classification of Words
While reading the Quran, we encounter numerous words (kalimah) on every page, which can be categorized into three parts of speech in the Arabic language:
- Ism `اِسْمٌ` (Noun)
- Fi'l `فِعْلٌ` (Verb)
- Harf `حَرْفٌ` (Particle)

</p>

**Note:** In English, it sometimes happens that a word belongs to two different categories, but in Arabic, each word must unambiguously belong to one of these categories with no room for belonging to two of them or any fourth category.

### Definition:
- **Ism:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is not linked to time.
- **Fi'l:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is also linked to time.
- **Harf:** Part of speech in Arabic that conveys meaning only when followed by another word.

## Identifying Ism, Fi'l and Harf in *English sentences*
**Method 1:** Break down each word in the English sentence, determine which definition it satisfies, and then map it to the corresponding part of speech in Arabic.

### Grouping of words
- In English, doer of the verb appears separate from the verb, whereas in Arabic, the subject (doer of the verb) and verb appear together in a single word. Therefore, when dealing with verbs in english sentences, we will combine them with the subject preceding it, treating them as a single unit, the fi'l, rather than addressing them separately.
- In English, articles appears separate from the noun, whereas in Arabic, the word itself contains the meaning of the article. Therefore, when dealing with nouns in sentences, we will combine them with any preceding articles, treating them as a single unit, the ism, rather than addressing them individually.

*Sentence:* I ate an apple yesterday.
- `I ate` : It conveys meaning and is also linked with time since it is in the past tense. Therefore, it is a Fi'l.
- `an apple` : It contains a meaning in itself, representing an eating object, and is timeless (not bound by time). Therefore, it is an Ism. 
- `yesterday` : It conveys a meaning as it is the name of the day, referring to the day that preceded today. It is not stuck in that time, rather, it is the name for a specific time. Therefore, it is an ism. (Explained below)

Alternatively, we can also say that all words that are neither fi'l nor harf belong to the Arabic part of speech Ism.

*Using Elimination Method: 'yesterday'* 
- **Checking Fi'l:** It cannot be a fi'l since it does not have any present, future, and past tenses.
- **Checking Harf:** It cannot be a harf since there is no word following it without which it won't make any sense.

## Mapping Parts of Speech
Now, we will explore the parts of speech in English that align with the definitions of ism, fi'l and harf. The parts of speech in Arabic that correspond to parts of speech in English are as follows:
- **Ism:** Noun, Pronoun, Adjective, Adverb, and Interjection
- **Fi'l:** Verb
- **Harf:** Preposition, and Conjunction

</p>

**Note:**
- Ism literally translates to "name", and a noun, which also signifies the name of something, which is why 'ism' is referred to as noun. However, this doesn't imply that it belongs to the noun parts of speech only.
- In Arabic grammar, the term "harf " is often referred to as a "particle“. These particles serve to connect words, convey relationships, and provide additional information in a sentence. Arabic particles in english are typically prepositions and conjunctions.
- We have not treated ‘Article’ as a separate part of speech because an article is nothing but a word that modifies a noun by indicating whether it is specific or general. We'll address this topic after discussing noun.

## Identifying Ism, Fi'l and Harf in *English sentences*
**Method 2:** Break down each word in the sentence, determine its part of speech in English, and then map it to the corresponding part of speech in Arabic.

*Sentence:* I ate an apple yesterday.
- `I ate` : Verb (Past Tense Verb) - Fi'l
- `an apple` : Noun (Thing) - Ism
- `yesterday` :  Adverb (Adverbs of Time) - Ism

## Identifying Ism, Fi'l and Harf in *Arabic sentences*
**Method:** Break down each word in the sentence, translate it into Englsih and then determine the corresponding part of speech in Arabic for the translated English word.

*Sentence:* أَكَلْتُ تُفَّاحَةً أَمْسِ
- **(I ate) `أَكَلْتُ`** : Fi'l
- **(an apple) `تُفَّاحَةً`** : Ism
- **(yesterday) `أَمْسِ`** : Ism

*Sentence 2:* أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ
- a. `أَكَلْتُ` : (In English: I ate) - Fi'l
- b. `تُفَّاحَةً` : (In English: an apple) - Ism
- c. `أَمْسِ` : (In English: yesterday) - Ism
