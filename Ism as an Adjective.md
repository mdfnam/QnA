# Ism as an Adjective

## Defining Adjective 
An adjective is a word that describes a noun or pronoun.

## Classification of Adjective 
Adjectives can be categorized into various types based on the characteristics they describe. Here are some common types of adjectives:
- Descriptive Adjectives
- Quantitative Adjectives
- Demostrative Adjectives
- Possessive Adjectives

### Descriptive Adjectives
- **Definition:** Descriptive adjectives are words that provide more information about the characteristics or qualities of a noun. They describe the appearance, size, color, shape, or other attributes of the noun or pronoun they modify.
- **Example:** In the phrase 'a *beautiful* masjid' the word "beautiful" is a descriptive adjective, adding information about the appearance of the flower.

### Quantitative Adjectives
- **Definition:** Quantitative adjectives are words that indicate the quantity or amount of a noun. Quantitative adjectives are primarily associated with numbers, amounts, or proportions, as demonstrated in the below examples.
- **Example 1:** In the phrase '*five* pillars of islam' the word "five" is a number-based quantitative adjective, specifying the number of items or individuals.
- **Example 2:** In the phrase '*many* believers' the word "many" is a amount-based quantitative adjective, specifying the amount or extent of something.
- **Example 3:** In the phrase '*half* an hour' the word "half" is a fraction-based quantitative adjective, specifying a fraction or a part of a whole.

### Demonstrative Adjectives
- **Definition:** Demonstrative adjectives always come before the noun and point to a specific noun in a sentence. They help to identify whether the noun is near or far in space.
- There are only four demonstrative adjectives: `This`, `Those`, `That`, and `These`.
- **Example:** In the phrase '*this* book' the word "this" is a demonstrative adjective, indicating a particular book that is near in distance.
- **Note:** There are also demonstrative pronouns which we will discuss in the pronouns section, and right there, we will also see the difference between the two.

### Possessive Adjectives
- **Definition:** Possessive adjectives are used to show ownership or possession of a noun. They typically come before the noun they modify to indicate to whom or to what something belongs.
- There are seven possessive adjectives: `My`, `Your`, `His`, `Her`, `Its`, `Our` and `Their`.
- **Examples:** In the phrase '*his* prayer mat' the word "his" is a possessive adjective, indicating that the prayer mat belongs to the person referred to as "his".
- **Note:** Because possessive adjectives and personal pronouns are closely related, we will revisit this topic when discussing personal pronouns.
