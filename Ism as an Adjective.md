# Ism as an Adjective

## Defining Adjective 
An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun.

### Classification of Adjective 
Adjectives can be categorized into various types based on the characteristics they describe. Here are some common types of adjectives:
- **Descriptive Adjectives:** These adjectives describe the qualities or characteristics of a noun, providing more information about its appearance, color, size, shape, etc.
- **Quantitative Adjectives:** These adjectives indicate the quantity or amount of the noun.
- **Demonstrative Adjectives:** These adjectives always come before the noun and point to a specific noun, indicating whether it is near or far in distance or time. There are only four demonstrative adjectives: `This`, `Those`, `That`, and `These`.
- **Possessive Adjectives:** These adjectives are used to show ownership or possession of a noun, typically come before the noun and indicate to whom or to what something belongs. There are seven possessive adjectives: `My`, `Your`, `His`, `Her`, `Its`, `Our` and `Their`.
