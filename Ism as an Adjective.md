Adjectives can be categorized into various types based on the characteristics they describe. Here are some common types of adjectives:
- Descriptive Adjectives

### Descriptive Adjectives
- **Definition:** Descriptive adjectives are words that provide more information about the characteristics or qualities of a noun. They describe the appearance, size, color, shape, or other attributes of the noun or pronoun they modify.
- **Example:** In the phrase 'a *beautiful* masjid' the word "beautiful" is a descriptive adjective, adding information about the appearance of the flower.

## Quantitative Adjectives
- **Definition:** Quantitative adjectives are words that indicate the quantity or amount of a noun. Quantitative adjectives are primarily associated with numbers, amounts, or proportions, as demonstrated in the below examples.
- **Example 1:** In the phrase '*five* pillars of islam' the word "five" is a number-based quantitative adjective, specifying the number of items or individuals.
- **Example 2:** In the phrase '*many* believers' the word "many" is a amount-based quantitative adjective, specifying the amount or extent of something.
- **Example 3:** In the phrase '*half* an hour' the word "half" is a fraction-based quantitative adjective, specifying a fraction or a part of a whole.





**Demonstrative Adjectives:** These adjectives always come before the noun and point to a specific noun, indicating whether it is near or far in distance or time. There are only four demonstrative adjectives: `This`, `Those`, `That`, and `These`.
**Possessive Adjectives:** These adjectives are used to show ownership or possession of a noun, typically come before the noun and indicate to whom or to what something belongs. There are seven possessive adjectives: `My`, `Your`, `His`, `Her`, `Its`, `Our` and `Their`.
