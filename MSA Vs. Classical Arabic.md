# MSA Vs. Classical Arabic

## MSA - It is evolved
- MSA is the form of Arabic which has evolved over time, undergoing significant changes due to the evolution of language to meet the changing linguistic needs of the Arab world. It has developed from Classical Arabic and incorporates some simplifications in grammar and vocabulary as societies and communication methods have evolved. 
- Therefore, we will study the evolution of language, examining the significant changes that have taken place in contemporary Arabic, which were absent in ancient times. This exploration is crucial as Modern Standard Arabic, though beneficial for understanding contemporary usage, may not be the most suitable for those aiming to study the Quran.

### Evolution of Language
Over the course of time, languages undergo an evolutionary process, resulting in their classification into two distinct forms: Ancient and Modern variations; these two forms differ in several aspects. Below, we will explore three points related to the evolution of any language.
- Simplification of Words
- Emergence of New Words
- Contextual Evolution of Words

### Simplification of Words
- Throughout the passage of time, languages have a tendency to undergo a process of simplification in terms of their grammar and vocabulary. This simplification involves the shedding of complex and advanced words, and the adaptation of more straightforward, simplified linguistic structures and terminology.
- Consequently, in MSA we encounter simplified versions of certain words which were previously substituted with alternative words. Therefore, the language has undergone a process of lexical simplification, reflecting a conscious effort to adapt to contemporary linguistic needs. 
- **Note:** This lexical simplification can be observed when languages are passed down from one generation to the next, they tend to gradually lose their essence. This is particularly noticeable when Arab people today read the Quran or any text from ancient times, it often becomes challenging to comprehend.

### Emergence of New Words
- Societal advancements, including the introduction of new technologies, interactions with other languages through trade or conquest, and the emergence of cultural influences, contribute to the development of new words within languages.
- Consequently, in MSA, we encounter many words that held no relevance in ancient times. Therefore, today's contemporary Arabic includes vocabulary and expressions relevant to contemporary society, technology, and various fields.
- **Note:** This linguistic expansion occurred when diverse cultures embraced Islam and adopted Arabic as a second language, infusing their own words and speaking styles into the language, thereby reflecting the cultures of their respective regions, which was not the case initially, as Arabic was confined solely within the borders of the Arabian Desert.

### Contextual Evolution of Words
- As languages evolve over time, the usage of words undergoes a significant transformation, resulting in shifts in their contextual meaning. This evolution is characterized by repurposing of old words, as they are applied in different contexts compared to their original usage.
- Consequently, being proficient in MSA doesn't ensure a perfect understanding of ancient texts, as the meaning one attribute to word might differ from their historical usage (as shown below). Therefore, knowing the contemporary meaning of a word doesn't necessarily lead to an accurate interpretation of how that word was used in the past.

## Classical Arabic - It is preserved
- Classical Arabic is considered dead today because it is no longer spoken. Nevertheless, religious scriptures such as the Quran and Hadith have played a crucial role in its preservation. Despite the influence of various cultures and languages on Arabic over time, classical Arabic has not been significantly impacted. It has remained largely preserved in its written form for religious and literary purposes. This preservation is attributed to its significance in religious and literary contexts, where precise interpretation and understanding are crucial.
- The credit for this preservation goes to the Islamic scholars, who not only documented the ancient grammar and kept records of the meanings of words, along with how Arabic Bedouins used them but also passed this knowledge down from generation to generation. As a result, individuals studying anywhere in the world today can seamlessly refer to these sources, ensuring a profound understanding of the original meanings and contextual usage of words as they existed in times long past.

</p>

- After observing the difference between the two, we are now certain that if we want to excel in the understanding of the Quran, then we need to commence our journey with Classical Arabic to better understand it.
