# Approach for Learning

## Essential language learning skills
Continuing our exploration of learning Quranic Arabic from the previous topic, let's now delve into the four essential skills needed to learn a language:
1. Reading with comprehension
2. Listening with comprehension
3. Speaking properly
4. Writing properly

### Different Approaches
Now we will discuss about the two approaches that people typically take when learning any language. 
- **Approach 1:** Starting with speaking skills.
- **Aprroach 2:** Starting with reading skills and then comprehending the written text.

### Our Approach
Since our main focus is on comprehending the Quranic text, we will be adopting the second approach. Now, let's explore the reasons for not choosing the first approach and why we are opting for the second approach with the perspective of understanding quranic arabic:
- **Problem with Apporach 1:** A common issue arises when we prioritize speaking skills at the expense of understanding written text. In such cases, we are taught only how to construct sentences from our thoughts, with insufficient emphasis placed on the crucial aspect of understanding the written text. Consequently, even after years of study, when we read the Quran, we might not feel a strong connection. This happens because the emphasis was on output (speaking) rather than input (understanding what you read).
- **Why to choose Approach 2:** When studying Arabic as a Muslim, a primary motivation often lies in the desire to connect with the Quran while reading. Therefore, top priority is given to developing skills in reading Classical Arabic with comprehension. Proficiency in these skills will lead to a deep moral connection with the Quran. Thus, it is crucial to start by mastering the art of reading with comprehension.

### Prerequisite For This Course
- A fundamental prerequisite for undertaking this course is having the ability to read Arabic, particularly Quranic Script. Without this foundational skill, you cannot pursue this particular course.
- If you already possess the capability to read Arabic, even if you encounter difficulties with certain words or are not proficient in tajweed (it is the set of rules and guidelines for the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Qurâ€™an), you are still eligible to enroll in the course.
- However, I want to emphasize that if you do not have a basic understanding of how to read Quranic Arabic, you must learn it before taking this course.
- **Advise:** You can read the Quran for 10 minutes daily online, practice it on `quran.com`, select a reciter there, and try to synchronize your voice along with the reciter. This practice will enhance your pronunciation and reading of Quranic Arabic.

### Understanding a Language
- **Requirements:** To comprehend a language, one needs knowledge of two fundamental aspects: Vocabulary and Grammar. We will commence our journey by exploring grammar, and as the need arises, we will gradually incorporate vocabulary into our learning process.
- **Importance of Grammar:** Grammar teaches us the way to put vocabulary in a proper and organized way so that it makes sense. After learning it, we will not only be able to translate a sentence correctly but also understand why and how these words are arranged together in that particular way.

Now, we will explore the branches of Arabic, wherein we'll discover that each branch is associated with a distinct aspect of the Arabic language. We'll identify the branch that is connected with the study of grammar and commence our studies accordingly.
