# Case Endings

## Defining I'raab
- I’raab (In Arabic: إِعْرَابُ) refers to case endings, which are signs or case markers found at the end of a word. It encompasses the identification of the grammatical case of a word, as indicated by its ending, through which we can determine the role and function the word is playing in the sentence.
- **Note:** A single, separate word does not necessarily need to have a case ending, but it becomes necessary when we use the word in a sentence, whether we pronounce it or not. Example: مُسْلِم (base word not having any case marker present at the last letter)
- Depending on the number and gender of an ism, we have different endings for each of them. These combinations include singular, dual (pair), masculine plural and feminine plural forms. Note that there is no difference in the endings of singular & pair forms of masculine and feminine genders.
- Therefore, there are more than three case markers or signs available. This is because an ism can show its status in different ways, depending on its number and gender.

## Types of Ending
There are two types of Ending:
- Ending Sound (one single vowel change at the end) : Singular
- Ending Combination (combination of vowel & letters change at the end) : Pair, Masculin and Feminine Plural
**Note:** We will also analyse the grammatical case (Raf’, Nasb & Jarr) associated with each ending.

## Ending Sounds and Combination & Their Status
### Singular Ending Sound & Its Status
There are three ending sounds:
- un ` ٌ` - Raf' status
- an ` ً` - Nasb status
- in ` ٍ` - Jarr status

</p>

**Note:**
- An ism ending with tanween is considered singular. However, it can also be used in the plural form, & we will explore this aspect later in the course.
- This ending sound can be used for both genders, whether masculine or feminine.

**Example:** The `مُسْلِم` (masculine) & the `مُسْلِمَة` (feminine) is the base word here and the case marker is the Double Vowels (Tanween-تَنوِين) that sits on the last letter & changes to show different cases.

</p>

### Pair Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three ending combinations:
- aani `انِ َ` - Raf' status
- ayni `ينِ َ` - Nasb status
- ayni `ينِ َ` - Jarr status

</p>

**Note:**
- The nasb & jarr forms are identical in this and every upcoming combination. The distinction between them relies on context, which we will learn to recognize later in our study.
- An ism ending with these combinations is always considered as dual & can be used for both genders.

**Example:** The `مُسْلِم` (masculin) & the `مُسْلِمَة` (feminine) is the base word here & everything beyond that is case marker (combination of haraka placed on last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

### Plural Masculine Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three masculine ending combinations:
- uuna `ونَ ُ` - Raf' status
- eena `ينَ ِ` - Nasb status
- eena `ينِ َ` - Jarr status

</p>

**Example:** The `مُسْلِم` (masculine) is the base word here & everything beyond that is the case marker (combination comprises a haraka that sits on the last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

</p>

**Note:**
- The plural masculine form is only used to indicate plural entities associated with humans & may be extended to jinns.
- This form can also be used for a group of individuals where the gender composition is either mixed or unspecified.
- The word `مُسْلِمُوْنَ` and `مُسْلِمِيْنَ` is used to refer to the people including both genders or only masculine, therefore it can be used to address Muslim men or whole muslim community.

### Plural Feminine Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three masculine ending combinations:
- aatun `اتٌ َ` - Raf' status
- aatin `اتٍ َ` - Nasb status
- aatin `اتٍ َ` - Jarr status

</p>

**Example:** The `مُسْلِم` (masculine) is the base word here also & everything beyond that is case marker (combination comprises a haraka that sits on the last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

<p align="center">

</p>

**Note:**
- The plural feminine form can be used for people but is not only limited to them. Example: سَمَاوَاتٌ (Skies).
- This form can only be used for a group consisting only females. (can not use in addressing muslim community).
- The word `مُسْلِمَاتٍ` and `مُسْلِمَاتٌ` is used to refer to the people including only feminine gender, therefore it can be used to address Muslim women only.
