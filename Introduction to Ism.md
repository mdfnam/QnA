### What will you learn
- **Status:** You will learn how the status of an Ism, whether in the nominative (raf'), accusative (nasb), or genitive (jarr) case, affects its role in a sentence and its relationship with other words.
- **Number:** You will grasp how isms can take singular (mufrad), dual (muthanna), or plural forms (Jama'), and how this affects other elements in a sentence.
- **Gender:** You will learn how to identify the gender of an Ism whether it is Masculine (muzakkar) or Feminine (mu'annas) by mastering the signs of Feminine Isms and their identification.
- **Type:** You'll learn how to differentiate between the types of isms by recognizing the signs that distinguish Definite Isms (marifah) and Indefinite Isms (nakirah).

**Note:** We will start our study with Status and then move on to Number, Gender and Type.
