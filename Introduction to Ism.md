### What will you learn
- **Case:** You will learn how the case of an Ism, whether in the nominative (Raf'), accusative (Nasb), or genitive (Jarr) case, affects its role in a sentence and its relationship with other words.
- **Number:** You will grasp how isms can take singular (Mufrad), dual (Muthanna), or plural (Jama') forms, and how this affects other elements in a sentence.
- **Gender:** You will learn how to identify the gender of an Ism whether it is Masculine (Muzakkar) or Feminine (Mu'annas) by mastering the signs of Feminine ism and their identification.
- **Type:** You'll learn how to differentiate between the types of isms by recognizing the signs that distinguish Definite (Marifah) and Indefinite (Nakirah) ism.

**Note:** We will start our study with Case and then move on to Number, Gender and Type.
