# Cases of Ism

## Similarities
We will explore one similarity between things that exist in Arabic as well as in English also.

**Three Cases:** In Arabic, similar to English, we also have three grammatical cases of an Ism:
- Raf' `رَفْعٌ` : Nominative (Doer of the act)
- Nasb `نَصْبٌ` : Accusative (Receiver of the act)
- Jarr `جَرٌّ` : Genitive (Possessor of a thing)

**Note:**
- Raf’ is also know as the default case. If there is no reason for an ism to be assigned to a different case, it remains in the Raf' case (also called as dictionary form).
- At times, Raf' is alternatively described as Marfu' مَرْفُوْعٌ, Nasb as Mansub مَنْصُوْبٌ, and Jarr as Majrur مَجْرُوْرٌ, although there exist slight distinctions between them.
- Raf', nasb and jarr refer to the grammatical cases of an ism, while marfu', mansub and majrur refer to the ism itself in these respective states.
- *Example:* Al-baitu `البَيْتُ` : We can say al-baitu is Marfu' (an ism which is in raf' form) or, we can also say al-baitu has Raf‘ case or in Raf’ form.

## Differences
We will explore two differences between things that exist in Arabic but are not present in English.

**1. Case Inflection:** English has relatively minimal case inflection, founds only in pronouns, when compared to the Arabic language. In English, nouns in any grammatical case remain identical to the base or dictionary form of the word. Determining the case of a noun involves asking questions (in the nominative and accusative cases) or observing signs (in the genitive case).Whereas in Arabic, an Ism undergo inflection in various cases, resulting in distinct forms with different case endings through which we can easily determine the case which eliminates the need for questioning as required in English. Consequently, the role of an Ism will play in a sentence can be identified without relying on its placement in the sentence or the surrounding context.

*Sentence 1:* A muslim (مُسْلِمٌ) prays five times a day.
- Here, the noun "muslim" is the subject as it represents the person who performs the action of praying. From another perspective, it can also be viewed as the answer to the question 'who prays?'.
- Now, in English, the noun "muslim" in the nominative case is represented the same way. However, in Arabic, the raf' case of the ism "muslim" is *muslimum* (In Arabic: مُسْلِمٌ), where the base word is "muslim" and nominative case is indicated by its ending "un".

*Sentence 2:* He met a muslim (مُسْلِمًا) in the university.
- Here, the noun "muslim" is the object as it represents the person who receive the action of meeting. From another perspective, it can also be viewed as the answer to the question 'Whom did he meet?'.
- Now, in English, the noun "muslim" in the accusative case is represented the same way. However, in Arabic, the nasb case of the ism "muslim" is *musliman* (In Arabic: مُسْلِمًا), where the base word is "muslim" and accusative case is indicated by its ending "an".

*Sentence 3:* This is the book of a muslim (مُسْلِمٍ).
- Here, the noun "muslim" is the possessor as it is the person who owns the book. From another perspective, it can also be viewed as the word which is after "of".
- Now, in English, the noun "muslim" in the genitive case is represented the same way. However, in Arabic, the jarr case of the ism "muslim" is *muslimin* (In Arabic: مُسْلِمٍ), where the base word is "muslim" and genitive case is indicated by its ending "in".

**2. Cases Beyond Nouns and Pronouns:** In English, cases are only related to nouns and pronouns. However, in Arabic, the ism that fall into the categories of adjectives, adverbs, or interjections also have cases, whereas this is not the case in English.
