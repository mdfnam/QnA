# Kinds of Words in Arabic

## Components of the Arabic Language
- **Lafz `لَفْظ`:** The word lafz means “an utterance”. It refers to every sound produced by the tongue. These utterances can be further divided into two categories based on whether they convey meaning or not: Muhmal and Mawdu.
- **Muhmal `مُهْمَل`:** Refers to meaningless words that do not carry any meaning. We will not study them.
- **Mawdu `مَوْضُوع`:** Refers to meaningful words that carries meaning. Our main focus during our studies will be on these words.
- **Mufrad `مُفْرَد`:** Refers to a single meaningful word.
- **Murakkab `مُرَكَّب`:** Refers to the combination of two or more individual words (mufrad).

- **Kalimah `كَلِمَة`:** A single meaningful utterance is referred to as ‘kalimah’. It can be further divided into three types also called ‘parts of speech’.

## Classification of Words
While reading the Quran, we encounter numerous words (kalimah) on every page, which can be categorized into three parts of speech in the Arabic language:
- Ism `اِسْمٌ` (Noun)
- Fi'l `فِعْلٌ` (Verb)
- Harf `حَرْفٌ` (Particle)

### Definition:
- **Ism:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is not linked to time.
- **Fi'l:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is also linked to time.
- **Harf:** Part of speech in Arabic that conveys meaning only when followed by another word.

### Note: 
- Each word must fit unequivocally into one of these categories, with no room for belonging to two of them or creating a fourth category.
- Ism literally translates to 'name,' and a noun, which also signifies the name of something, which is why 'ism' is referred to as a noun. However, this doesn't imply that it belongs to the noun parts of speech only.
- In Arabic, the subject (doer of the verb) and verb appear together in a single word. For example, يَنْصُرُ (yansuru) means “he helps”. That’s why we refer Fi’l as ‘More than a Verb’.
- In Arabic grammar, the term "harf " is often referred to as a "particle“. These particles serve to connect words, convey relationships, and provide additional information in a sentence. Arabic particles in english are typically prepositions and conjunctions.
- We have not treated ‘Article’ as a separate part of speech because an article is nothing but a word that modifies a noun by indicating whether it is specific or general. We'll address this topic after discussing noun.
