# Kinds of Words in Arabic

## Components of the Arabic Language
- **Lafz `لَفْظ`:** It specifically refers to a single word or a single utterance. These utterances can be further divided into two categories based on whether they convey meaning or not: Muhmal and Mawdu.
- **Muhmal `مُهْمَل`:** Refers to meaningless words that do not carry any meaning. Because we are studying the Quran in which there is no meaningless word present, therefore, we will not study them.
- **Mawdu `مَوْضُوع`:** Refers to meaningful words that carries meaning. Our main focus during our studies will be on these words.
- **Mufrad `مُفْرَد`:** Refers to a single meaningful word.
- **Murakkab `مُرَكَّب`:** Refers to the combination of two or more individual words (mufrad).

- **Kalimah `كَلِمَة`:** A single meaningful utterance is referred to as ‘kalimah’. It can be further divided into three types also called ‘parts of speech’.

## Classification of Words
While reading the Quran, we encounter numerous words (kalimah) on every page, which can be categorized into three parts of speech in the Arabic language:
- Ism `اِسْمٌ` (Noun)
- Fi'l `فِعْلٌ` (Verb)
- Harf `حَرْفٌ` (Particle)

**Note:** In English, it sometimes happens that a word belongs to two different categories, but in Arabic, each word must unambiguously belong to one of these categories with no room for belonging to two of them or any fourth category.

### Definition:
- **Ism:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is not linked to time.
- **Fi'l:** Part of speech in Arabic that indicates a meaning in itself and is also linked to time.
- **Harf:** Part of speech in Arabic that conveys meaning only when followed by another word.

**Example:**

*Sentence:* I ate an apple yesterday.
- `I` : It is an ism as it contains a meaning in itself, representing myself, and is not bound by time.
- `ate` : It is a fi'l as it conveys meaning and is also linked with time since it is in the past tense.
- `an` : It is a harf that conveys meaning only when followed by a word (noun).
- `apple` : It is an ism as it contains a meaning in itself, representing an eating object, and is timeless.
- `yesterday` : It is an ism again. *Explanation:* It is not a fi’l, instead, it is the name of the day. The word 'yesterday' refers to the day that preceded today. It is not stuck in that time, rather, it is the name for a specific time. Therefore, it is an ism.

## Mapping Parts of Speech
Parts of speech in English that correspond to parts of speech in Arabic are as follows:
- Ism: noun, pronoun, adjective, adverb and interjection
- Fi'l: verb
- Harf: preposition, conjunction and article

</p>

**Note:**
- Ism literally translates to 'name,' and a noun, which also signifies the name of something, which is why 'ism' is referred to as a noun. However, this doesn't imply that it belongs to the noun parts of speech only.
- In Arabic, the subject (doer of the verb) and verb appear together in a single word. For example, `يَنْصُرُ` (yansuru) means “he helps”. That’s why we refer Fi’l as ‘More than a Verb’.
- In Arabic grammar, the term "harf " is often referred to as a "particle“. These particles serve to connect words, convey relationships, and provide additional information in a sentence. Arabic particles in english are typically prepositions, conjunctions and articles.

**Example:**

*Sentence:* I ate an apple yesterday.
- `I` : Pronoun (First Person Pronoun) - Ism
- `ate` : Verb (Past Tense Verb) - Fi'l
- `an` : Article (Indefinite Article) - Harf
- `apple` : Noun (Thing) - Ism
- `yesterday` :  Adverb (Adverbs of Time) - Ism
