# Harf as an Article

## Defining Articles
Articles precede nouns, serving the purpose of indicating whether the noun refers to something specific & identifiable or something nonspecific & general. In English, we have three articles, they are `a`, `an` and `the`.

### Classification of Articles 
Articles can be classified into two categories based on their function in English grammar:
- Definite Article
- Indefinite Articles

### Definite Article
- **Definition:** Definite article (the) is used before a noun that both the speaker and the listener know about or have previously discussed. It can be used before both proper and common nouns.
- **Example 1:** In the phrase 'The Quran' (used before a proper noun), the word "the" functions as a definite article, indicating a particular Quran known to both the speaker and the listener. It could refer to a particular Quran mentioned earlier or known within the context.
- **Example 2:** In the phrase 'The book' (used before a common noun), the word "the" functions as a definite article, indicating that there is a particular book both the speaker and the listener are familiar with or have been discussing.

</p>

**Note:** 
- In Arabic, we use "ال" (pronounced as "al") as the definite article, which is attached to the beginning of a word.
- When you encounter the prefix "al" attached to a word, it signifies that the word belongs to the category of 'ism'.
- In English, word "the" appears separate from the actual word, whereas in Arabic, the word itself contains the meaning of ‘the’, so we often need two English words to express what a single Arabic word conveys.


### Indefinite Article
- **Definition:** Indefinite articles (a & an) are used before non-specific or unknown singular common nouns.
- **Example 1:** In the phrase 'A book' (used before singular common noun), the word "a" functions as a indefinite article, indicating a non-specific or generic item.
- **Example 2:** In the phrase 'An elephant' (used before singular common noun), the word "an" functions as a indefinite article, indicating a non-specific or unidentified member of the elephant species.

**Note:**
- Unlike English, Arabic lacks a distinct word equivalent to the English indefinite articles 'a' or 'an'. Instead, the sense of indefiniteness is often conveyed through the absence of the definite article 'ال' and the presence of tanween at the end.
- An ism cannot simultaneously be definite and indefinite. Therefore, tanween (double vowel sign indicating indefiniteness in Arabic grammar) and 'al' (the definite article in Arabic) cannot coexist on it.
- When translating "كِتَابٌ" independently, it is often rendered as 'book'. In Englis, when we use a singular, unspecified common noun within a sentence, it's common to use an indefinite article before it. Consequently, when "كِتَابٌ" is integrated into a sentence, it will be translated as 'a book.'
