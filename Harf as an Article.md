# Harf as an Article

## Defining Articles
Articles precede nouns, serving the purpose of indicating whether the noun refers to something specific & identifiable or something nonspecific & general. In English, we have three articles, they are `a`, `an` and `the`.

### Classification of Articles 
Articles can be classified into two categories: Definite Article and Indefinite Article.

### Definite Article
- Definite Article (the): It is used before a noun that both the speaker and the listener know about or have previously discussed. It can be used before both proper and common nouns.
- Example: “The Quran” (used before proper noun), "The book" (used before common noun)

**Note:** 
- In Arabic, we use ‘ال’  (pronounced as ‘al’) as the definite article, which is attached to the beginning of a word.
- In English, word ‘the’ appears separate from the actual word, whereas in Arabic, the word itself contains the meaning of ‘the’, so we often need two English words to express what a single Arabic word conveys.

### Indefinite Article
- Indefinite Articles (a & an): These are used before general or nonspecific nouns, primarly with singular common nouns.
- Example: “A book” or “An elephant” (used before singular common noun)

</p>

**Note:**
- Unlike English, Arabic lacks a distinct word equivalent to the English indefinite articles 'a' or 'an.' Instead, the sense of indefiniteness is often conveyed through the absence of the definite article 'ال'.
- When translating "كِتَابٌ" independently, it is often rendered as 'book'. In Englis, when we use a singular, unspecified common noun within a sentence, it's common to use an indefinite article before it. Consequently, when "كِتَابٌ" is integrated into a sentence, it will be translated as 'a book.'
