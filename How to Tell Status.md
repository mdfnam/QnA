# How to Tell Status

## Defining I'raab
- I’raab `إِعْرَابُ` refers to case endings, which are signs or status markers found at the end of a word. It encompasses the identification of the grammatical case of a word, as indicated by its ending, through which we can determine the role and function the word is playing in the sentence.
- **Note:** A single, separate word does not necessarily need to have a case ending, but it becomes necessary when we use the word in a sentence, whether we pronounce it or not. Example: مُسْلِم (base word - not having any status marker present at the last letter)
- Depending on the number and gender of an ism, we have different endings for each of them. These combinations include singular, dual (pair), masculine plural and feminine plural forms. Note that there is no difference in the endings of singular & pair forms of Mas.&Fem. genders.
- Therefore, there are more than three status markers or signs available. This is because an ism can show its status in different ways, depending on its number and gender.

## Types of Ending
There are two types of Ending:
- Ending Sound (one single vowel change at the end) : Singular
- Ending Combination (combination of vowel & letters change at the end) : Pair, Masculin and Feminine Plural
We will also analyse the grammatical case-status (Raf’, Nasb & Jarr) associated with each ending.

### Basics: 
We will learn about :
- Short Vowels (Haraka-حَرَكَة)
- Double Vowels (Tanween-تَنوِين)

</p>

**Note:**
- Here the dotted circle represents the last letter, but it can be any letter within the word. Since we are currently focusing on grammatical cases (status), our primary emphasis is on the last letter of the word.
- The absence of diacritical marks or vowel signs implies that the letter has a sukun on it. When necessary, we can also explicitly write the sukun mark on the letter. This means that in the topics mentioned above, we can put a sukun on the letters alif, waw, and yaa.

#### Taa marbuta
- Taa marbuta is a special version of the letter ت. Here, the term ‘marbuta’ means: tied; as if the two ends of the taa have been brought together and tied up on top, making it look like `ة` .
- It only appears at the end of a word and can be written in two ways: `ة` or `ـة` . It is written as `ة` when not connected to the preceding letter and as `ـة` when connected.
- It is pronounced with a ‘`هـ`-ha’ sound if we pause on it , that is when there is no short vowel or tanween above it, and it is pronounced with a ‘`ت`-t’ (taa maftuha) sound if it is vowelized.
- To make a singular masculine word feminine, simply add a taa marbuta to the end of the word. Example: Feminine of the word `مُسْلِمْ` (muslim) is `مُسْلِمَةْ` (muslimah). Note: -Not every word ending with it is a feminine. -Adding it is not the only way to make a word fem.
- The letter that precedes the taa marbuta always has a fatha on it. The only exception is the alif because it cannot be accompanied by any of the short vowels & always carries a sukun on it.
- Tanween-fatha must sit on either an alif or a taa marbuta. This is why alif get added after the letter when we put the sign on it. Example: alif gets added after meem in `مُسْلِمًا` but not in `مُسْلِمَةً`
- When we add any suffix (for status purpose) to taa marbuta, it changes to a regular taa bcz nothing can get attached to it. Example: Adding alif after taa marbuta in `مُسْلِمَةَ` makes it `مُسْلِمَتَا`

## Singular Ending Sound & Its Status
There are three ending sounds:
- un ` ٌ` - Raf' status
- an ` ً` - Nasb status
- in ` ٍ` - Jarr status

</p>

**Note:**
- An ism ending with tanween is considered singular. However, it can also be used in the plural form, & we will explore this aspect later in the course.
- This ending sound can be used for both genders, whether masculine or feminine, for status purposes.

Example: The مُسْلِم (masculine) & the مُسْلِمَة (feminine) is the base word here and the status marker is the Double Vowels (Tanween-تَنوِين) that sits on the last letter & changes to show different status.

## Pair Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three ending combinations:
- aani `انِ َ` - Raf' status
- ayni `ينِ َ` - Nasb status
- ayni `ينِ َ` - Jarr status

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mdfnam/QnA/assets/156814846/ed5e25f6-2933-437a-a2a7-d7326775554d" width="230">
</p>

**Note:**
- The nasb & jarr forms are identical. The distinction between them relies on context, which we will learn to recognize later in our study.
- An ism ending with these combinations is always considered as dual & can be used for both genders.

Example: The مُسْلِم (mas.) & the مُسْلِمَة (fem.) is the base word here & everything beyond that is status marker (combination of haraka placed on last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

## Plural Masculine Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three masculine ending combinations:
- uuna `ونَ ُ` - Raf' status
- eena `ينَ ِ` - Nasb status
- eena `ينِ َ` - Jarr status

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mdfnam/QnA/assets/156814846/5d2e2ac5-4de9-4c6b-9885-d4cc382a4440" width="230">
</p>

**Note:**
- The nasb & jarr forms are identical. The distinction between them relies on context, which we will learn to recognize later in our study.
- An ism ending with these combinations is always considered as plural and masculine.

Example: The مُسْلِم (mas.) is the base word here & everything beyond that is the status marker (combination comprises a haraka that sits on the last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mdfnam/QnA/assets/156814846/c8b1db0a-f6b0-4f3c-b1d6-2c9d76f062d9" width="200">
</p>

**Note:**
- The plural masculine form is only used to indicate plural entities associated with humans & may be extended to jinns.
- This form can also be used for a group of individuals where the gender composition is either mixed or unspecified.
- The word مُسْلِمُوْنَ and مُسْلِمِيْنَ is used to refer to the people including both genders or only masculine,  therefore it can be used to address Muslim men or whole muslim community.

# Plural Feminine Ending Combination & Its Status
There are three masculine ending combinations:
- uuna `اتٌ َ` - Raf' status
- eena `اتٍ َ` - Nasb status
- eena `اتٍ َ` - Jarr status

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mdfnam/QnA/assets/156814846/6bd0549c-f372-4457-8ad8-8ec942c79ef1" width="250">
</p>

**Note:** 
- The nasb & jarr forms are identical. The distinction between them relies on context, which we will learn to recognize later in our study.
- An ism ending with these combinations is always considered as plural and feminine.

Example: The مُسْلِم (mas.) is the base word here also & everything beyond that is status marker (combination comprises a haraka that sits on the last letter followed by two addidtional letter).

<p align="center">

</p>

**Note:**
- The plural feminine form can be used for people but is not only limited to them. Example: سَمَاوَاتٌ (Skies)
- This form can only be used for a group consisting only females. (can not use in addressing muslim community).
- The word مُسْلِمَاتٍ and مُسْلِمَاتٌ is used to refer to the people including only feminine gender, therefore it can be used to address Muslim women only.
