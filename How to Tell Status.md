# How to Tell Status

## Defining I'raab
- I’raab `إِعْرَابُ` refers to case endings, which are signs or status markers found at the end of a word. It encompasses the identification of the grammatical case of a word, as indicated by its ending, through which we can determine the role and function the word is playing in the sentence.
- **Note:** A single, separate word does not necessarily need to have a case ending, but it becomes necessary when we use the word in a sentence, whether we pronounce it or not. Example: مُسْلِم (base word - not having any status marker present at the last letter)
- Depending on the number and gender of an ism, we have different endings for each of them. These combinations include singular, dual (pair), masculine plural and feminine plural forms. Note that there is no difference in the endings of singular & pair forms of Mas.&Fem. genders.
- Therefore, there are more than three status markers or signs available. This is because an ism can show its status in different ways, depending on its number and gender.

## Types of Ending
There are two types of Ending:
- Ending Sound (one single vowel change at the end) : Singular
- Ending Combination (combination of vowel & letters change at the end) : Pair, Masculin and Feminine Plural
We will also analyse the grammatical case-status (Raf’, Nasb & Jarr) associated with each ending.
