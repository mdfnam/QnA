# How to Tell Status

## Defining I'raab
- I’raab `إِعْرَابُ` refers to case endings, which are signs or status markers found at the end of a word. It encompasses the identification of the grammatical case of a word, as indicated by its ending, through which we can determine the role and function the word is playing in the sentence.
- **Note:** A single, separate word does not necessarily need to have a case ending, but it becomes necessary when we use the word in a sentence, whether we pronounce it or not. Example: مُسْلِم (base word - not having any status marker present at the last letter)
- Depending on the number and gender of an ism, we have different endings for each of them. These combinations include singular, dual (pair), masculine plural and feminine plural forms. Note that there is no difference in the endings of singular & pair forms of Mas.&Fem. genders.
- Therefore, there are more than three status markers or signs available. This is because an ism can show its status in different ways, depending on its number and gender.

## Types of Ending
There are two types of Ending:
- Ending Sound (one single vowel change at the end) : Singular
- Ending Combination (combination of vowel & letters change at the end) : Pair, Masculin and Feminine Plural
We will also analyse the grammatical case-status (Raf’, Nasb & Jarr) associated with each ending.

### Basics: 
We will learn about :
- Short Vowels (Haraka-حَرَكَة)
- Double Vowels (Tanween-تَنوِين)

**Note:**
- Here the dotted circle represents the last letter, but it can be any letter within the word. Since we are currently focusing on grammatical cases (status), our primary emphasis is on the last letter of the word.
- The absence of diacritical marks or vowel signs implies that the letter has a sukun on it. When necessary, we can also explicitly write the sukun mark on the letter. This means that in the topics mentioned above, we can put a sukun on the letters alif, waw, and yaa.

#### Taa marbuta
- Taa marbuta is a special version of the letter ت. Here, the term ‘marbuta’ means: tied; as if the two ends of the taa have been brought together and tied up on top, making it look like `ة` .
- It only appears at the end of a word and can be written in two ways: `ة` or `ـة` . It is written as `ة` when not connected to the preceding letter and as `ـة` when connected.
- It is pronounced with a ‘`هـ`-ha’ sound if we pause on it , that is when there is no short vowel or tanween above it, and it is pronounced with a ‘`ت`-t’ (taa maftuha) sound if it is vowelized.
- To make a singular masculine word feminine, simply add a taa marbuta to the end of the word. Example: Feminine of the word `مُسْلِمْ` (muslim) is `مُسْلِمَةْ` (muslimah). Note: -Not every word ending with it is a feminine. -Adding it is not the only way to make a word fem.
- The letter that precedes the taa marbuta always has a fatha on it. The only exception is the alif because it cannot be accompanied by any of the short vowels & always carries a sukun on it.
- Tanween-fatha must sit on either an alif or a taa marbuta. This is why alif get added after the letter when we put the sign on it. Example: alif gets added after meem in `مُسْلِمًا` but not in `مُسْلِمَةً`
- When we add any suffix (for status purpose) to taa marbuta, it changes to a regular taa bcz nothing can get attached to it. Example: Adding alif after taa marbuta in `مُسْلِمَةَ` makes it `مُسْلِمَتَا`
