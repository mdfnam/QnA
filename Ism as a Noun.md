# Ism as a Noun

## Defining Noun
A noun is a word that represents a being, place, thing or idea.
- **beings :** It refers to the creator and all of his living creations : people, animal, angel, jinn and devil.
- **place :** It refers to a location or an area.
- **thing :** It refers to non living object which you can see and touch.
- **Idea :** It refers to an abstract notion or a concept that have not any physical presence.

**Note:** In the context of our discussion, we have included the term 'creator' within the section labeled 'beings' for linguistic or grammatical purposes only, while acknowledging that Almighty is beyond all categories and limitations.

### Classification of Noun
Nouns can be classified into two main categories: Proper nouns and Common nouns.
- **Proper nouns** are specific name of any particular being, place, thing or concept. They are always capitalized.
- **Common nouns** are more generic (nonspecific) as they represent general name for any being, place, thing, or concept. They are only capitalized when they start a sentence.

**Note:** Using ‘the’ before a common noun does not make it proper but rather definite.

**Note:** When discussing the word 'Allah’, it is important to use "The Word Allah" for being respectful as we are discussing the word 'Allah’, not addressing Allah (SWT) Himself.

## Idea
- **Identification:** Abstract nouns often represent `concepts` (justice, freedom and mercy), `emotions` (happiness, sorrow and anger), `thoughts` (opinion, theory and imagination), `beliefs` (hope, faith and trust), `feelings` (love, fear and excitement), `qualities` (beauty, honesty and intelligence), or `states of being` (confusion, anxiety and peace).
- **Suffixes:** Certain suffixes can indicate abstract nouns. For example, words ending with `ism` (capitalism, socialism), `ity` (equality, purity), `ment` (development, improvement), `tion` (education, communication), `ance` (guidance, acceptance), `sion` (collision, decision) and `ing` (swimming, cooking) are often associated with abstract concepts.
- **Gerund:** A gerund (pronounced jer-and) is a form of a verb that functions as a noun in a sentence. It is created by adding the "ing" suffix to the base form of a verb. *Example:* The word `swimming` can function as both a verb and a gerund (a verbal noun). As a verb: "I am swimming in the pool". Here, `swimming` is used as a present participle verb indicating the action of swimming. As a gerund: "Swimming is good exercise". In this case, `swimming` is used as a gerund, functioning as a noun. It represents the idea or concept of the activity rather than describing a specific action.
