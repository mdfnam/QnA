# Ism as a Noun

## Defining Noun
A noun is a word that represents a being, place, thing or idea.
- **beings :** It refers to the creator and all of his living creations : people, animal, angel, jinn and devil (Shaytan).
- **place :** It refers to a location or an area.
- **thing :** It refers to non living object which you can see and touch.
- **idea :** It refers to an abstract notion or a concept that cannot be perceived through the senses.

**Note:** In the context of our discussion, we have included the term "creator" within the section labeled "beings" for linguistic or grammatical purposes only, while acknowledging that Almighty is beyond all categories and limitations.

## Classification of Noun
Nouns can be classified into various categories based on their characteristics and functions they play in a sentence. Here are some common classifications of nouns:
- Abstract Nouns
- Proper Nouns
- Common Nouns
- Collective Nouns
- Possessive Nouns

## Abstract Nouns
- **Definition:** Abstract nouns refer to entities that cannot be physically touched or have any physical presence; instead, they are more theoretical or conceptual in nature.
- **Example:** In the phrase 'Her *kindness*', the word "kindness" is an abstract noun, representing the quality or concept of being kind.

### Identification
Abstract nouns often represent below intangible entities:
- **concepts:** justice, freedom, mercy
- **emotions:** happiness, love, excitement
- **beliefs:** hope, faith, trust
- **qualities:** beauty, honesty, intelligence
- **state of being:** confusion, anxiety, peace

### Suffixes
Certain suffixes can indicate abstract nouns. For example, words ending with:
- **ism:** capitalism, socialism, hinduism
- **tion:** education, communication, imagination
- **ance:** guidance, acceptance, resistance
- **sion:** collision, decision, comparison
- **ing:** swimming, cooking, learning

### Gerund
- A gerund (pronounced jer-and) is a form of a verb that functions as a noun in a sentence. It is created by adding the "ing" suffix to the base form of a verb. *Example:* The word "swimming" can function as both a verb and a gerund (a verbal noun).
- **As a verb:** 'I am swimming in the pool'. Here, "swimming" is used as a present participle verb indicating the action of swimming.
- **As a gerund:** 'Swimming is good exercise'. In this case, "swimming" is used as a gerund, functioning as a noun. It represents the idea or concept of the activity rather than describing a specific action.

## Proper Nouns
- **Definition:** Proper nouns refer to specific, unique individuals. They used to represent the proper name of any particular being, place, thing, or idea. They are always capitalized.
- **Example:**  In the phrase 'I visited *Madina*', the word "Madina" is a proper noun, indicating a specific city.

## Common Nouns
- **Definition:** Common nouns refer to general, non-specific classes of entities. They used to represent the generic name for any being, place, thing, or idea. They are only capitalized when they start a sentence.
- **Example:** In the phrase 'The *teacher*', the word "teacher" is a common noun, representing a general category of educators.

**Note:** Using "the" before a common noun does not make it proper but rather definite.

**Note:** When discussing the word "Allah", it is important to use the phrase 'The Word Allah' to be respectful, as we are referring to the word rather than addressing Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala) himself. Thus, we state here that 'The word Allah is a proper noun'.

## Collective Nouns
- **Definition:** Collective nouns refer to groups of people, animals, or things as a single entity. They used to represent a collection or gathering of individuals.
- **Example:** In the phrase 'A *nation*' the word "nation" is a collective noun, representing a group of individuals united by a common identity or citizenship.

## Possessive Nouns
- **Definition:** Possessive nouns refer to a noun indicating possession or ownership. They can also be used to indicate a relationship or a sense of belonging.
- **Example 1:** In the phrase 'My *friend's* book', the word "friend's" is a possessive noun, indicating that the book is owned by my friend.
- **Example 2:** In the phrase 'The *Quran's* verses', the word "Quran's" is a possessive noun, indicating that the verses belong to the Quran.
- **Example 3:** In the phrase '*Fatima's* father', the word "Fatima's" is a possessive noun, indicating a father-daughter relationship between them.

### Understanding Terms
- **Possessor:** refers to the individual who owns or possesses something (owner).
- **Possessed object:** refers to the item being possessed (the thing that is owned).
- In the above examples, `friend`, `Quran` and `Fatima's` are the possessors, while `book`, `verses` and `father` are the possessed objects.

### Expressing possession
- This possession is typically expressed by an apostrophe followed by an “s” on the possessor, and then the possessed object.
