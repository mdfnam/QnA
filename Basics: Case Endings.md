**Note:**
- Here the dotted circle represents the last letter, but it can be any letter within the word. Since we are currently focusing on grammatical cases (status), our primary emphasis is on the last letter of the word.
- The absence of diacritical marks or vowel signs implies that the letter has a sukun on it. When necessary, we can also explicitly write the sukun mark on the letter. This means that in the topics mentioned above, we can put a sukun on the letters alif, waw, and yaa.

### Taa marbuta
- Taa marbuta is a special version of the letter ت. Here, the term ‘marbuta’ means: tied; as if the two ends of the taa have been brought together and tied up on top, making it look like `ة` .
- It only appears at the end of a word and can be written in two ways: `ة` or `ـة` . It is written as `ة` when not connected to the preceding letter and as `ـة` when connected.
- It is pronounced with a ‘`هـ`-ha’ sound if we pause on it , that is when there is no short vowel or tanween above it, and it is pronounced with a ‘`ت`-t’ (taa maftuha) sound if it is vowelized.
- To make a singular masculine word feminine, simply add a taa marbuta to the end of the word. Example: Feminine of the word `مُسْلِمْ` (muslim) is `مُسْلِمَةْ` (muslimah). **Note:** -Not every word ending with it, is a feminine. -Adding it, is not the only way to make a word feminine.
- The letter that precedes the taa marbuta always has a fatha on it. The only exception is the alif because it cannot be accompanied by any of the short vowels & always carries a sukun on it.
- Tanween-fatha must sit on either an alif or a taa marbuta. This is why alif get added after the letter when we put the sign on it. **Example:** alif gets added after meem in `مُسْلِمًا` but not in `مُسْلِمَةً`
- When we add any suffix (for status purpose) to taa marbuta, it changes to a regular taa bcz nothing can get attached to it. **Example:** Adding alif after taa marbuta in `مُسْلِمَةَ` makes it `مُسْلِمَتَا`
