### Nominative Case
- **Definition:** The nominative case, also known as subjective case, is used for the subject of a sentence, which is typically a noun or a pronoun that performs the action of the verb or is the "doer" of the action in a sentence.
- **Identification:** To identify a noun or pronoun in the nominative case, form a question using 'What?' or 'Who?' before the verb. Use 'What?' when the noun or pronoun represents a thing and 'Who?' when it represents a person.
- **Position:** Nouns or pronouns which are in the nominative case generally appears before the verb (Subject + Verb).
