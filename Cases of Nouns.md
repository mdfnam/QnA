### Expressing possession
In English, possession can be expressed through:
- **Apostrophe possession:** This possession is expressed by the apostrophe followed by an “s” on possessor & then the possessed object. This form is used when we want to emphasize the possessor.
- **"of " possession:** This possession is expressed by the possessed object followed by "of " and then the possessor. This form is used when we want to emphasize the possessed thing.
- **Possessive adjective possession:** This possession is expressed by the possessive adjective (which is possessor) followed by the possessed object. These adjectives directly modify the noun to show possession.
