## Nominative Case
- **Definition:** The nominative case, also known as subjective case, is used for the subject of a sentence, which is typically a noun or a pronoun that performs the action of the verb or is the "doer" of the action in a sentence.
- **Identification:** To identify a noun or pronoun in the nominative case, form a question using 'What?' or 'Who?' before the verb. Use 'What?' when the noun or pronoun represents a thing and 'Who?' when it represents a person.
- **Position:** Nouns or pronouns which are in the nominative case generally appears before the verb (Subject + Verb).

## Accusative Case
- **Definition:** The accusative case, also known as objective case, is used for the direct object of a sentence, which is typically a noun or a pronoun that receive the action of the verb or is the "receiver" of the action in a sentence.
- **Identification:** To identify a noun or pronoun in the accusative case, form a question using 'What?' or 'Whom?' before the verb and its subject. Use 'What?' when the noun or pronoun represents a thing, and use 'Whom?' when it represents a person.

**Note:** The indirect object is a noun or pronoun in a sentence that indicates to whom or for whom the action of the verb is done. It answers the question "to whom" or "for whom" concerning the direct object. Here, in last example, "him" is an indirect object (the person to whom the Quran is given).

## Genitive Case
- **Definition:** The genitive case, also known as possessive case, is used to express possession or ownership. In the genitive case, the noun which is the possessor or possessive adjectives takes on the genitive form to indicate possession or a relationship with another noun, which is the possessed or owned object.
- **Identification:** To identify a noun or adjective in the genitive case, ask the question 'Whose?' before the noun. This will help determine the possessor or the one to whom something belongs.
- **Position:** Includes possessive nouns, nouns after the preposition 'of', and possessive adjectives.
