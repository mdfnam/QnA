### Colloquial Arabic
- **Definition:** Colloquial Arabic, aslo known as Spoken Arabic, is the informal spoken form of Arabic that Arabs use to communicate in their daily lives. It differs from region to region, which is referred to as dialects. All the Arabic dialects have their unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, reflecting the historical, geographical, and cultural influences on the region.
- **Examples:** Five unique dialects originating from different regions across the Arab world are: the Egyptian dialect, Moroccan dialect, Syrian (Levantine) dialect, Gulf dialect, Hijazi dialect and many more.
- **Challenges:** Depending on their place of origin, individuals may exhibit variations in accent, expression, and idiom usage, contributing to potential comprehension challenges, despite sharing a common foundation in the language.

### Modern Standard Arabic
- **Definition:** Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), also known as Fus-ha `الْفُصْحَى`, is a standardized and formal version of Arabic which solves the issue of Colloquial Arabic by serving as a universal linguistic platform for Arabic speakers from different regions, ensuring mutual comprehension regardless of their native dialects.
- **Use of MSA:** Modern Standard Arabic is the official form of Arabic taught in schools and universities and is used in formal contexts, including literature, books, magazines, media, legal documents, and official communications throughout the Arab world. If your aim is to learn Arabic that is widely spoken and understood throughout the Arab world today, then learning MSA would be a great choice.
- **Quran Prespective:** Learning MSA for Quranic comprehension is discouraged, as the Quran is primarily written in Classical Arabic. While MSA shares similarities with Classical Arabic, including much of the same grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, there are significant linguistic differences that arise due to the *evolution of language* (next topic). These differences can hinder a deep understanding of the Quranic text. Hence, relying solely on MSA may not ensure an accurate understanding of the Quranic language, highlighting the need to learn Classical Arabic for accurate interpretation.

### Clasical Arabic
- **Definition:** Classical Arabic, also known as Ancient Arabic, denotes the particular form of the Arabic language used in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. It encompasses the linguistic norms and standards prevalent during the period of the Quran's revelation and in the early centuries of Islam. This variant of Arabic stands out for its sophistication, rich vocabulary, complex grammar structures, and notable beauty.
- **Motive to learn:** In this course, our primary goal is to comprehend the Quran, making Classical Arabic our main subject of study. Learning it is crucial for individuals seeking a precise understanding of the message in the Quran and Hadith. It enables a direct and accurate engagement with the scriptures, preventing potential misinterpretations that may arise from relying solely on translations.
- **Significance of Classical Arabic:** Since the Quran was addressed to the ancient Arabs during the time of the Prophet (pbuh), it is important for individuals to gain insights into the precise manner of communication used by the people of that era in order to attain a profound comprehension of the Quran's divine message. Therefore, it is considered important for all Muslims to acquire knowledge of Classical Arabic.

**Dua:** 
> ### رَبِّی یَسِّرْ وَلَا تُعَسِّرْ وَ تَمِّمْ بِالْخَیْر
    My Lord, make it easy and do not make it difficult, and complete it with goodness

**Next:** We will now study the evolution of language, examining the significant changes that have taken place in contemporary Arabic, which were absent in ancient times. Our main focus will be on understanding why avoiding learning MSA is recommended if we want to comprehend the Quran.
