# Kinds of Arabic
## Classification of Arabic
Arabic can be classified into three primary kinds:
- Colloquial Arabic 
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Classical Arabic
### Colloquial Arabic
- **Definition:** Colloquial Arabic, aka Spoken or Daily Arabic, is the informal spoken form of Arabic that Arabs use to communicate in their daily lives. It differs from region to region, which is referred to as dialects. All the Arabic dialects have their unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, reflecting the historical, geographical, and cultural influences on the region.
- **Examples:** Five unique dialects originating from different regions across the Arab world: the Egyptian dialect, Moroccan dialect, Syrian (Levantine) dialect, Gulf dialect, and Hijazi dialect.
- **Challenges:** Depending on their place of origin, individuals may exhibit variations in accent, expression, and idiom usage, contributing to potential comprehension challenges among speakers of the same language despite having a common foundation in the language.

### Modern Standard Arabic
- **Definition:** Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), aka Fus-ha `الْفُصْحَى`, is a standardized and formal version of Arabic that serves as a universal linguistic platform for Arabic speakers from different regions, ensuring mutual comprehension regardless of their native dialects.
- **Use of MSA:** Modern Standard Arabic is the official form of Arabic taught in schools and universities and is used in formal contexts, including literature, books, magazines, media, legal documents, and official communications throughout the Arab world.

### Clasical Arabic
- **Definition:** Classical Arabic, aka Ancient or Quranic Arabic, is the specific form of the Arabic language used in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. This Arabic is what Arab tribes used to communicate among themselves around 1,400 years ago. This form of Arabic was more sophisticated, rich in vocabulary, had complex grammar structures, and was significantly more beautiful.
- **Significance of Classical Arabic:** Since the Quran was addressed to the ancient Arabs during the time of the Prophet (pbuh), it is important for individuals to gain insights into the precise manner of communication used by the people of that era in order to attain a profound comprehension of the Quran's message. Therefore, it is considered important for all Muslims to acquire knowledge of Classical Arabic.
