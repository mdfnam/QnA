# Kinds of Arabic

## Classification of Arabic
Arabic can be classified into three primary kinds:
- Colloquial Arabic 
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Classical Arabic

### Colloquial Arabic
- **Definition:** Colloquial Arabic, aka Spoken Arabic, is the informal spoken form of Arabic that Arabs use to communicate in their daily lives. It differs from region to region, which is referred to as dialects. All the Arabic dialects have their unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, reflecting the historical, geographical, and cultural influences on the region.
- **Examples:** Five unique dialects originating from different regions across the Arab world are: the Egyptian dialect, Moroccan dialect, Syrian (Levantine) dialect, Gulf dialect, Hijazi dialect and many more.
- **Challenges:** Depending on their place of origin, individuals may exhibit variations in accent, expression, and idiom usage, contributing to potential comprehension challenges, despite sharing a common foundation in the language.

### Modern Standard Arabic
- **Definition:** Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), aka Fus-ha `الْفُصْحَى`, is a standardized and formal version of Arabic which solves the issue of Colloquial Arabic by serving as a universal linguistic platform for Arabic speakers from different regions, ensuring mutual comprehension regardless of their native dialects.
- **Use of MSA:** Modern Standard Arabic is the official form of Arabic taught in schools and universities and is used in formal contexts, including literature, books, magazines, media, legal documents, and official communications throughout the Arab world.
- **Similarities:** The two types of Arabic, MSA and Classical Arabic, are very similar, sharing a lot of the same grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure. This means that if you know one, you can understand the other to some extent.

### Clasical Arabic
- **Definition:** Classical Arabic, aka Ancient or Quranic Arabic, denotes the particular form of the Arabic language used in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. It encompasses the linguistic norms and standards prevalent during the period of the Quran's revelation and in the early centuries of Islam. This variant of Arabic stands out for its sophistication, rich vocabulary, complex grammar structures, and notable beauty.
- **Motive to learn:** Learning classical Arabic is crucial for individuals seeking a precise understanding of the message in the Quran and Hadith. It enables a direct and accurate engagement with the scriptures, preventing potential misinterpretations that may arise from relying solely on translations.
- **Significance of Classical Arabic:** Since the Quran was addressed to the ancient Arabs during the time of the Prophet (pbuh), it is important for individuals to gain insights into the precise manner of communication used by the people of that era in order to attain a profound comprehension of the Quran's divine message. Therefore, it is considered important for all Muslims to acquire knowledge of Classical Arabic.

**Dua:** 
> ### رَبِّی یَسِّرْ وَلَا تُعَسِّرْ وَ تَمِّمْ بِالْخَیْر
    My Lord, make it easy and do not make it difficult, and complete it with goodness

## Evolution of a Language
Over the course of time, languages undergo an evolutionary process, resulting in their classification into two distinct forms: Ancient and Modern variations; these two forms differ in several aspects. Below, we will explore three points related to the evolution of any language.
- Simplification of Words
- Adaptation of New Words
- Contextual Evolution of Words

### Simplification of Words
- Throughout the passage of time, languages have a tendency to undergo a process of simplification in terms of their grammar and vocabulary. This simplification involves the shedding of complex and advanced words, and the adoption of more straightforward, simplified linguistic structures and terminology.
- It can also be observed when languages are passed down from one generation to the next, they tend to gradually lose their essence.

### Adaptation of New Words
- Societal advancements, including the introduction of new technologies, interactions with other languages through trade or conquest, and the emergence of cultural influences, contribute to the adaptation of new words within languages.
- When diverse cultures embraced Islam and adopted the Arabic language, they infused their own words and speaking styles into the Arabic language, reflecting the cultures of their respective regions. Over time, due to the influence of non-native speakers, the overall sophistication of the Arabic language began to decline.

### Contextual Evolution of Words
- As languages evolve over time, the usage of words undergoes a significant transformation, resulting in shifts in their contextual meaning. This evolution is characterized by repurposing of old words, as they are applied in different contexts compared to their original usage.
- Consequently, being proficient in MSA doesn't ensure a perfect understanding of ancient texts, as the meaning one attribute to word might differ from their historical usage. Therefore, knowing the contemporary meaning of a word doesn't necessarily lead to an accurate interpretation of how that word was used in the past.

## Preservation of Classical Arabic
- Classical Arabic is considered dead today because it is no longer spoken. However, religious scriptures such as the Quran and Hadith have played a crucial role in preserving it. Despite the influence of various cultures and languages on Arabic over time, these influences did not significantly impact Classical Arabic. Credit for this preservation goes to Islamic scholars, who not only documented the ancient grammar and keep recorded of the meanings of words, along with how Arabic Bedouins used them but also passed this knowledge down from generation to generation. As a result, individuals studying anywhere in the world today can seamlessly refer to these classical sources, ensuring a profound understanding of the original meanings and contextual usage of words as they existed in times long past.

## Summary
Arabic, a diverse language, is classified into Colloquial, Modern Standard (MSA), and Classical forms. Colloquial, informal and region-specific, poses challenges in comprehension due to varying dialects. MSA, a standardized version, promotes mutual understanding among Arabic speakers globally, used in education, media, and formal contexts. Classical Arabic, from the Quran, is vital for understanding Islamic scriptures, distinct for its richness and complexity. Languages, including Arabic, evolve over time, simplifying grammar, adopting new words, and changing contextual meanings. MSA proficiency doesn't guarantee understanding ancient texts, emphasizing the importance of learning Classical Arabic for accurate interpretation of it. Despite the influence of diverse cultures, Classical Arabic remains intact through religious texts, necessitating reference to the works of various scholars to obtain the exact definition and usage of any word in a particular context.
